## Introduction
The Reversal Point MT5 code is a custom indicator that analyzes market data to identify potential reversal points. It uses specified input parameters such as the period for analyzing market data, the price type to use for analysis, and the shift in bars for analysis. The code generates alerts when potential reversal points are detected.

## Features
- Custom indicator for reversal point detection
- Ability to define input parameters for analysis
- Visual and/or audible alerts for potential reversal points
- Trade object for generating alerts

## Installation
To use the Reversal Point MT5 code, follow these steps:
1. Open the MetaEditor in your MetaTrader 5 platform.
2. Create a new Expert Advisor (EA) and name it 'ReversalPoint_MT5'.
3. Copy and paste the code into the new EA file.
4. Save the EA file and compile it.
5. Attach the EA to a chart of your choice.

## Usage
The Reversal Point MT5 code is executed through the `OnTick()` function, which is called on every tick of the market. The code first calls the `ReversalPointIndicator()` function to determine if a reversal point is detected. If a reversal point is detected, the code then calls the `GenerateAlert()` function to generate visual and/or audible alerts.

You can customize the input parameters in the code by modifying the values assigned to them. These parameters include:
- `Period`: The period for analyzing market data.
- `PriceType`: The price type to use for analysis.
- `Shift`: The shift in bars for analysis.
